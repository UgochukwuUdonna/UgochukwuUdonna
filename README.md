Welcome to my GitHub page. My name is Ugochukwu (Ugo), and I'm a Geography and GIS Master's Candidate at Southern Illinois University, Edwardsville, where I study remote sensing, data analytics, and machine learning. My research and academic work range from change detection, image classification, ecology/ecosystem modeling, land change science, and beyond.

Some of the things I have been working on:


💻 I’m currently working on applying remote sensing technology and algorithms to understand ecological events and conservation issues across the United States.

⚡ Also working on building Machine Learning models for real-time data collection and mapping of natural disasters in conservation areas.

🛰 Previous research in Change Detection of the Amazon Basin and Animal Biodiversity.

📫 Ask me about JavaScripting, Wika, R, and Python for remote sensing and geospatial analysis!
